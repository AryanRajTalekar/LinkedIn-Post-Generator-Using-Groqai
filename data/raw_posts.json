We discuss. We build. We take time.\nWe’ve missed some opportunities by not chasing trends — and that’s okay.\n\nBecause our focus has never been to “blow up.”\nIt’s been to build up — brick by brick, with the community, for the long run.\n\nFrom being a course catalog →\nWe’re now moving towards a complete 1-stop learning platform —\nfor both college students and working professionals.\n\nLive classes, structured pathways, mentorship, doubt support, and everything else a learner truly needs.\n\nSlow growth isn’t boring.\nIt’s sustainable.\nIt’s real.\n\nVisit codehelp: https://www.codehelp.in/",

    "text": "Seniors, what do you think ?\n\nOver the last couple of years, the tech space has exploded with buzzwords — AI, blockchain, prompt engineering, and what not.\n\nIt’s great to explore these. But in the process, I see a lot of students ignoring something that still holds massive weight in interviews:\n\nDSA.\n\nInterviews haven’t suddenly become fancy.\nDSA is still the go-to tool to assess your problem-solving skills, logic, and thinking under pressure.\n\nSo here’s my two cents — don’t overlook it.\nStrengthen your fundamentals. It still matters.\n\n🎓 If you’re just getting started, my DSA playlist on YouTube is completely free.\n\n💥 And if you want to stay away from distractions, join our CodeHelp Supreme DSA community — live classes, weekly revisions, problem-solving, doubt support, and collective growth.\n\nP.S. The real intent of this post was to guide you, not to market… but koi nahi, ab toh hogya 😅\n\nLastly — calling out to all my friends/Seniors in the industry:\nWhat’s the current DSA trend in your company’s interview process?\nDrop your experience in the comments — it’ll really help the students and switchers out here.\n\nLet’s guide the next wave together. 🙌\n\n🚨 Oh, and one last thing —\nThe 50% DISCOUNT on every Code Help course ends in the next 48 HOURS.\nVisit Codehelp: https://lnkd.in/gNdHbWN7\n\nhashtag#DSA hashtag#CodeHelp",

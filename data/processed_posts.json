It still matters.\n\n\ud83c\udf93 If you\u2019re just getting started, my DSA playlist on YouTube is completely free.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 And if you want to stay away from distractions, join our CodeHelp Supreme DSA community \u2014 live classes, weekly revisions, problem-solving, doubt support, and collective growth.\n\nP.S. The real intent of this post was to guide you, not to market\u2026 but koi nahi, ab toh hogya \ud83d\ude05\n\nLastly \u2014 calling out to all my friends/Seniors in the industry:\nWhat\u2019s the current DSA trend in your company\u2019s interview process?\nDrop your experience in the comments \u2014 it\u2019ll really help the students and switchers out here.\n\nLet\u2019s guide the next wave together. \ud83d\ude4c\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Oh, and one last thing \u2014\nThe 50% DISCOUNT on every Code Help course ends in the next 48 HOURS.\nVisit Codehelp: https://lnkd.in/gNdHbWN7\n\nhashtag#DSA hashtag#CodeHelp",
